# Installation<a name="installation"></a>
The jupyter notebook file should be run with python 3.X . review_frequency.ipynb should install nltk and download associate files.

# Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
I'm interested in answering the 3 questions from the Seattle Airbnb Open data set:
1. How to predict the listings price? What's the factors that mostly contribute to determine a property price.
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices like?
3. How did the reviewer describe the lodging they are served. What the most frequency words they used to describe their experience from Airbnb?

# File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
'price_predict' is to build a linear regression model and random forrest regression model to predict price .
'busiest_month' is to find out the best time to visit Seattle with lowest average price.
'review_frequency' is used nltk to find out the top 5 words to describe the living service guests had experienced from Airbnb.

# Results<a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@mxbj2005/seattle-airbnb-price-prediction-and-more-643175a9be39)

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/home). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
